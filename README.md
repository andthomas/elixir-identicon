# Identicon

This project was built as a part of [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial) tutorials.

The program takes a string and produces a unique png based off the string provided. Images are not generated randomly i.e the string "Andy" will always return the same image.

Example

```
iex> Identicon.main("Andy")
```

returns 

![Andy.png](https://i.imgur.com/2vNeI9H.png)
